# Process Data Part 1

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fix the Variable Names]

When we print the 2016 dataset, we notice that the variable names are incorrect. Let’s verify that by looking at the first ten variable names of the 2016 dataset, which is the fifth element of all_files:

```{r}
names(all_files[[5]])[1:10]
```
To fix it, we’ll read the 2016 dataset again using read_csv() and the fifth element of filenames but this time will use the argument skip = 3. We’ll assign the newly read dataset to the fifth element of the all_files list:

```
all_files[[5]] <-
  # Skip the first 3 lines instead of the first 4
  read_csv(filenames[[5]], skip = 3)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Pick Variables 1]

* Our analytic questions are about gender, so let's pick the gender variable
* Later, we'll need to filter our dataset by disability category and program location so we'’'ll want `SEA Education Environment` and `SEA Disability Category`
* We want to make comparisons by state and reporting year, so we'll also pick `State Name` and `Year`

```
all_files[[1]] %>%
  select(
    Year,
    contains("State", ignore.case = FALSE),
    contains("SEA", ignore.case = FALSE),
    contains("male")
  )
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Pick Variables 2]
```
# build the function
pick_vars <-
  function(df) {
    df %>%
      select_at(vars(
        Year,
        contains("State", ignore.case = FALSE),
        contains("SEA", ignore.case = FALSE),
        contains("male")
      ))
  }

# use the function with `all_files`
all_files <-
  all_files %>%
  map(pick_vars)

```{r}
child_counts %>%
  # count number of times the category appears in the dataset
  count(`SEA Disability Category`) %>%

```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Choose Category]

Since we will be visualizing and modeling gender variables for all students in the dataset, we’ll filter out all subgroups except “All Disabilities” and the age totals:

```{r, results = FALSE}
child_counts <-
  child_counts %>%
  filter(
    # filter all but the All Disabilities category
    `SEA Disability Category` == "All Disabilities",
    # filter all but the age totals
    `SEA Education Environment` %in% c("Total, Age 3-5", "Total, Age 6-21")
  ) 
```

    # change these columns to more convenient names

    disability = "SEA Disability Category",
    f_3_5 = "Female Age 3 to 5",
    m_3_5 = "Male Age 3 to 5",
    f_6_21 = "Female Age 6 to 21",
    m_6_21 = "Male Age 6 to 21"

Compare the male student count to the female student count using a ratio.

* Use `pivot_wider()` to create separate columns for male and female students.

## Model the Data

--

We'll explore the relationship between male and female student counts in our special education dataset. In particular, we'll test the hypothesis that this ratio has decreased over the years. Fitting a linear regression model that estimates the year as a predictor of the male to female ratio will help us do just that.

## What'd we learn?

We learned from that male to female ratios did not change in any meaningful way from 2012 to 2017 and that the median ratio across states was about two male students to every female student.

1. Each state has a different count of students with disabilities–so different that we need to use statistics like ratios or visualizations to compare across states.

2. The five states we looked at have increased their student with disabilities counts.

3. Our model suggests that these decreases do not represent a big difference.

## Conclusion

1. **Further analyses**: While we explored student counts across each state and verified that there is variation in the counts, a good next step would be to combine these data with total enrollment data. <span style="background-color: #87af49">What other analyses should we run to add to this linear regression?</span>

2. **Contextual data**: What is happening in these states around students with disabilities (policy? systems?) that we could use to build upon our results?

3. <span style="background-color: #87af49">What other questions are raised from this analysis and what steps should we take in the future?</span>
